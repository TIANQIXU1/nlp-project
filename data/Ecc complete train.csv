Sentence,s522,"False-positive rates are also higher at facilities serving vulnerable women (women of racial or ethnic minorities and women with lower educational attainment, limited household income, or rural residence) than at facilities serving nonvulnerable women, perhaps because of poorer compliance with recommendations for follow-up examinations",此外，为弱势群体的女性（少数民族或种族的女性、或低教育程度、低收入及乡村妇女）提供服务的机构相比于为非弱势群体的女性服务的机构，其假阳性率也会较高；这可能是因为该群体的女性患者对于进行进一步检查的依从性更差
Sentence,s523,"A telephone survey of 308 women performed 3 months after screening mammography revealed that about one-fourth of the 68 women with a “suspicious” result were still experiencing worry that affected their mood or functioning, even though subsequent testing had ruled out a cancer diagnosis",一项电话调研一共调查了308例女性，这些受试者均在调查前3个月接受过乳腺钼靶筛查，结果显示68例女性的检查结果为“可疑”，而这些女性中四分之一的受试者直至接受调查时仍然存在担忧。这种情绪严重影响了患者的情绪和社会活动，即使后续的检查结果已经排除了乳腺癌的诊断
Sentence,s524,"The Million Women Study in the United Kingdom revealed three patient characteristics that were associated with decreased sensitivity and specificity of screening mammograms in women aged 50 to 64 years: use of postmenopausal hormone therapy, prior breast surgery, and body mass index below 25",英国百万妇女研究发表的结果显示，对于50-64岁间的女性患者，以下三种患者特征与乳腺X线摄影筛查的敏感性及特异性降低相关，包括：绝经后激素替代治疗、既往乳腺手术史及体重指数小于25
Sentence,s525,"The Canadian National Breast Screening Study-2 of women aged 50 to 59 years found a fourfold increase in DCIS cases in women screened by clinical breast examination (CBE) plus mammography compared with those screened by CBE alone, with no difference in breast cancer mortality",加拿大国家乳腺癌筛查研究-2招募了年龄在50至59岁的女性，分为2组，第一组采用临床乳腺检查（CBE）及乳腺X线摄影联合筛查乳腺癌；而第二组则单独采用CBE进行筛查，统计结果显示第一组发现的DCIS病例是第二组的4倍之多；而两组的乳腺癌死亡率并无差别
Sentence,s526,"The most important bias in this study is that the advent of screening in these counties occurred over a period during which dramatic improvements in the effectiveness of adjuvant breast cancer therapy were being made, changes which were not addressed by the study authors",该项研究中最重要的偏倚是，筛查项目在这些城市被推广应用的时间刚好处于乳腺癌辅助治疗手段突飞猛进的时期，而这些改变恰恰被试验的研究者忽略了

Sentence,s538,"After adjusting for changes in incidence due to hormone therapy and other undefined causes, the authors concluded that the screening effect on breast cancer mortality reduction (28% during this period) was small, and that overdiagnosis of breast cancer was likely between 22% and 31% of all diagnosed breast cancers",在调整了激素治疗及其他不确定因素对发病率的影响后，研究结果显示筛查本身导致乳腺癌相关死亡率下降的程度（试验期间为28%）很小，而在所有被诊断乳腺癌的病例中，过度诊断的比例约在22%到31%之间
